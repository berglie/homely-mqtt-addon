# Homely MQTT Home Assistant Add-on Repository

This repository contains a Home Assistant add-on for integrating Homely devices with MQTT.

## What's Fixed

- **404 Error Resolved**: Changed image reference from non-existent `homeassistant/{arch}-addon-homely-mqtt` to `local/{arch}-addon-homely-mqtt`
- **New Homely Logo**: Replaced Samba logo with custom Homely house icon
- **Local Build Support**: Added build script to create Docker images locally
- **Complete Source Code**: Added full TypeScript application structure

## Quick Installation

1. **Add this repository** to Home Assistant:
   - Go to Settings > Add-ons > Add-on Store
   - Click â‹® > Repositories
   - Add: `https://github.com/berglie/homely-mqtt-addon`

2. **Build the images locally** (required before installation):

   ./build.sh
   ```

3. **Install the add-on** from the Add-on Store
